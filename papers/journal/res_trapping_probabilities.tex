We evaluate the trapping probability for particles under the effect of
both a stationary and moving laser.  The trapping probabilities are
estimated on a discrete grid of positions relative to the focus of the
laser.  In all of our experiments, we consider a grid whose extents
match that of the discrete laser force grid $F$.  We sample this
grid in the $y$ and $z$ directions at a resolution of
$\SI{0.25}{\micro\meter}$.

\subsubsection{Trapping Probabilities under a Stationary Laser}

%Figures~\ref{fig:trapping-prob-static-gpu}
%and~\ref{fig:trapping-prob-static-cpu} illustrate how the probability
%of trapping a particle varies with respect to the particle's distance
%from the laser in both the $y$ and $z$ directions, under the influence
%of a stationary laser.  To verify the accuracy of our trapping
%probability estimates, we examine how the estimates computed using our
%GPU implementation differ from those computed using a CPU-based
%implementation of the same particle dynamics model.  Since the
%underlying governing equations are the same, and we perform a
%sufficient number of simulations (i.e. $1024$ per grid position) to
%ensure $95\%$ confidence in our probability estimate, we expect to see
%very little different between the two plots.  Indeed, an examination
%of Figures ~\ref{fig:trapping-prob-static-gpu}
%and~\ref{fig:trapping-prob-static-cpu} satisfies this expectation.

Figures~\ref{fig:trapping-prob-static-gpu} illustrates how the probability
of trapping a particle varies with respect to the particle's distance
from the laser in both the $y$ and $z$ directions, under the influence
of a stationary laser. To verify the accuracy of our trapping
probability estimates, we examine how the estimates computed using our
GPU implementation differ from those computed using a CPU-based
implementation of the same particle dynamics model. Since the
underlying governing equations are the same, and we perform a
sufficient number of simulations (i.e. $1024$ per grid position) to
ensure $95\%$ confidence in our probability estimate, we expect to see
very little difference between the two plots. Figure~\ref{fig:trapping-prob-static-cpu-gpu-error} 
shows the difference in probability estimates between the two implementations.
The average error between the CPU and the GPU implementation of the
probability estimate (computed using L2 norm) is $0.00091$.

We also examine the difference between probability estimates computed 
using single and double precision. We found the average error 
(computed using L2 norm) to be $ 0.00084$.

\subsubsection{Trapping Probabilities under a Moving Laser}

Figures~\ref{fig:trapping-prob-xyvel-gpu}, and \ref{fig:trapping-prob-zvel-gpu}
%\ref{fig:trapping-prob-xyvel-cpu}, , and
%\ref{fig:trapping-prob-zvel-cpu} 
illustrate how the probability of
trapping a particle varies with respect to the particle's distance from
the laser in both the $y$ and $z$ directions, under the influence of a
moving laser.  In particular, we consider a laser moving with a
constant velocity of $\SI{0.65}{\micro\meter\per\milli\second}$
in the $y$ direction as well as a laser moving with a constant
velocity of $\SI{0.325}{\micro\meter\per\milli\second}$ in the
$z$ direction.
