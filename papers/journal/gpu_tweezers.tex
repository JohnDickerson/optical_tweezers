\section{Introduction}

The simulation of particle movement under general force fields is of interest
across many scientific disciplines.  For example, biochemists may wish to model
stochastic diffusion of glutamate receptors~\cite{20233407}, while financial
analysts may attempt to simulate point estimates of stock prices based on stochastic
models~\cite{broadie2006exact}.  In this paper, we present a framework to
simulate such general particle movement under user-defined force fields.  We apply this
framework to the task of manipulating micro
and nanoscale components using an optical force field. 

Micro and nanoscale components can be
used to exploit new phenomena that take place at the small scale
~\cite{Bhus04}. Potential applications of such small components include
bio-sensors, electronic components, photonic devices, solar cells, and
batteries~\cite{Niem04,Wils02}.  In order to construct useful devices, micro and nanoscale components need to be
assembled together. Assembling small components to make functional
devices remains a challenge despite rapid advances in imaging,
measurement, and fabrication at the small scale. Two types of assembly
processes are possible at the small scale. The first type of process is
self-assembly~\cite{Requ06}. This process is useful for large scale
production. The second type of process is directed assembly. This
process is useful for prototyping new design concepts, small scale
production, device repair, and creating templates for certain types of
self-assembly processes. In this paper, we limit ourselves to directed
assembly processes. A number of manipulation techniques for directed
assembly of small components have emerged.

In order to manipulate a small component, the appropriate optical,
electrostatic, or magnetic field (i.e., trap) needs to be created to
trap the component. The field is then controlled to move the component. 
In this paper, we focus on the optical force fields and traps associated with them. 
Optical trapping takes place
in a fluidic workspace. The interaction between the optical field and the
component is stochastic in nature, due to the Brownian motion of the
component, as well as the presence of uncertainty in the component location as
a result of sensor errors. Unfortunately, the off-line planning
approach that works well at the macroscale does not work at the
small scale. To cope with the stochastic nature of the problem,
automated microscale assembly requires a real-time and automated
planning paradigm that takes actions based on the estimated state of
the workspace in a feedback loop~\cite{Banerjee:2010:ieee}.

In order to develop automated, real-time planning algorithms, we need
to develop a fundamental understanding of the interaction of
components with trapping fields. For example, we need to
understand and characterize trapping probability, trap reliability,
and trap robustness. The knowledge of the trapping probability will
enable us to position the optical trap close enough to the
component of interest so that it gets trapped. Moreover, any other
component that drifts close enough to the optical trap, such that its
trapping probability exceeds a certain threshold value, is a potential
or imminent source of unintended trapping. Thus, appropriate collision
prevention schemes need to be applied in such cases to avoid losing
the trapped component. Under different operating conditions,
components interact qualitatively differently with the
trap. Unfortunately, the parameter space that describes different
operating conditions is very large. Hence, simulation is the only
viable option for characterizing the interactions between the trap and
the component to facilitate real-time planning.   

This paper presents a GPU-based method to simulate the trajectory of 
particles under a force field. The method described in this
paper is able to handle time varying force fields. The accuracy of
computation depends on the accuracy of the force field. We illustrate
the usefulness of this method by showing how it can be
used to estimate trapping probabilities for moving optical traps. This
new method presents considerable computational improvements over our
previous approach to conducting CPU-based simulations for estimating
trapping probabilities. The work presented in this paper enables fast
computation of trapping probabilities. Faster computation of trapping
probabilities presents three main advantages. First, it enables
exploration of a much larger parameter space. Hence, it improves our
understanding of trapping physics. Second, fast computation of
trapping probabilities eliminates the need for the use of
meta-modeling during the particle transport planning. Finally, faster
computation enables more simulation runs and hence we get better
estimates of the trapping probability.


\section{Related Work}

Since the initial discovery of optical gradient
forces~\cite{ashkin1970acceleration} and subsequent invention of
optical tweezers~\cite{ashkin1986observation}, the use of optical
traps to manipulate micron-sized objects has been widespread.
Simulations of the optical traps play an important role in utilizing
optical tweezers as assembly tools at the micro and nanoscale~\cite{Banerjee:2010:ieee}. Early work in this area focused on
trap and particle interactions and models were developed to estimate
optical forces acting on spherical particles. As a part of our recent
prior work, we developed a model to simulate the trajectory of a
spherical particle under optical forces~\cite{
  banerjee2009generating}. This model was implemented on a CPU and used
to generate trapping probability estimates by conducting off-line
simulations. A meta-model was developed to quickly query trapping
probability estimates during the automated path
planning~\cite{Banerjee:2010:ieee}. CPU-based simulations are very
time consuming. Hence, in an offer to speed up the simulation process,
we successfully implemented Brownian motion simulation on
GPU~\cite{balijepalli2010stochastic}. The current paper builds on our
previous work and presents a new GPU-based method for computing
particle trajectories under optical force fields. In computing
particle trajectories, it combines both the influence of Brownian
motion and an optical force field in a single unified GPU-based
framework.

Graphics processors have evolved over the last decade from a
fixed-function (rendering-only) pipeline to a highly flexible
programmable pipeline.  One of the application areas that has received
significant attention in this evolution has been physically-based
simulations due to their application to simulation of environmental
effects for 3D games~\cite{Owens:2007:ASO}. Some of the earliest work
in this area involved physically-based wave simulations on 2D
lattices~\cite{James:2001:operations}. More general Lattice-Boltzmann
3D simulations for fluids and gases were later implemented on GPUs by
Li et al.~\cite{LWK03,LFWK05}. Other fluid simulations on GPUs include
work on Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids (see review
in this area by Harris~\cite{Harris:2005:fast-fluid}) as well as
Euler-equations-based dynamics of ideal gases (Hagen et
al.~\cite{Hagen:2006:euler}). Work on fluid simulation has also been
extended to deal with
obstacles~\cite{Bolz:2003:sparse,KW03,LLW04,STM04,Harris:2005:fast-fluid}. Visualization
of flows on GPUs has been addressed through line-integral convolution
and Lagrangian-Eulerian
advection~\cite{Heidrich:1999:pixel-textures,JEH01,WHE01}.  Recent
work by Juba and Varshney~\cite{Juba:2008:PSMM} shows the suitability
of the GPUs for stochastic calculations.

%, using Cg and CUDA respectively,
Initial work has been done porting optical trapping simulations to
graphics processors; however, to our knowledge, no GPU-based trapping
probability estimation work exists.  \cite{reicherter:59301Y} and
\cite{haist2006using} simulate the manipulation of glass microspheres
within a holographic laser testbed.  Due to accelerated
two-dimensional FFT calculations, both show significant computational
speedups over their CPU-based counterparts.  Similar results are
available for arbitrarily positioned dual-beam (``twin'')
traps~\cite{hermerschmidt2007holographic}.  Using a model similar to
ours, Balijepalli~\cite{balijepalli2010stochastic} provides an
accuracy and error analysis of results from both CPU and GPU, along
with experimental validation of the simulation.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We have introduced a GPU-based framework for massive simulation of particle
motion under user-defined force fields.  We applied this framework
experimentally to the well-studied problem of computing the trapping
probabilities associated with micron-sized silica beads in optical
trapping workbenches.  The simulator handles both stationary and
moving laser-induced force fields and, due to the highly parallel nature of the problem
and efficient use of the available hardware, exhibits a significant
speedup over its CPU-based analog. In particular, when evaluating many
trajectories ($4096$), we see approximately a $356$ times speedup of
the GPU based simulator over its CPU based counterpart.  This speedup
is more than can be accounted for by the increased processor count on
the GPU, and we attribute the extra performance to the higher memory
bandwidth, spatially coherent caching, and hardware accelerated
bilinear interpolation of the laser force field in the GPU simulator.
In particular, this last operation must be performed in software on
the CPU.  We believe this work indicates that GPUs hold great promise
in accelerating the type of compute-intensive simulations that are
required when working with optical tweezers and nanoscale assembly in
general.  Often times, the stochastic nature of such simulations leads
to a probabilistic approach involving many independent trials, a setup
whose parallelism uniquely suits the type of high-throughput
computation enabled by modern GPUs.

In the future, we are interested in extending this work to deal with
more general types of nanocomponents, perhaps even those which cannot
be defined analytically.  We are also interested in investigating
other areas of the optical workbench workflow where GPUs can be used
to accelerate computational bottlenecks in the process.
